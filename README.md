🙏 A note from the author

I’m a Linux user from Russia, living modestly — but I was determined not to give up on my old GPU.

This was my first real experience in maintaining and publishing a complete PPA, with DKMS, postinst scripts, and meta-packages.

💡 Without Andreas Beckmann’s prior packaging work, this would’ve never happened.

Huge thanks to him for continuing Debian support even in 2025.

P.S. This was my first full-fledged PPA.

P.P.S. And damn, I’m proud of it.
